# GitHub Copilot Integration

This workspace comes with GitHub Copilot preconfigured in the development container. When you open the workspace in VS Code with the Dev Containers extension, all necessary extensions and configurations are automatically set up.

## Prerequisites

You only need:

1. An active GitHub Copilot subscription

   - Individual subscription, or
   - Access through your organization's subscription
   - Students can get GitHub Copilot for free through the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

2. Authentication
   - Sign in to GitHub in VS Code when prompted
   - Authorize GitHub Copilot access when asked

That's it! The development container handles everything else automatically.

## Verification

To verify Copilot is working:

1. Open any code file
2. Start typing a comment describing what you want to do
3. Copilot should offer suggestions inline
4. Use `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) to see alternative suggestions

## Troubleshooting

If Copilot isn't working:

1. Verify your subscription status at https://github.com/settings/copilot
2. Check VS Code is signed in to GitHub
3. Try rebuilding the dev container
4. Ensure you've accepted the Copilot terms of service

Note: The GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat extensions are automatically installed by the dev container configuration - you don't need to install them manually.

## Copilot Optimization Tips

### Inline Code Comments

Use descriptive comments above functions to help Copilot understand:

```powershell
# Scans .NET project for vulnerable NuGet packages and returns vulnerability report
# Parameters:
# - ProjectPath: Path to .NET project/solution
# - MinimumSeverity: Minimum severity level to report (Critical/High/Moderate/Low)
function Get-DotnetVulnerabilities {
    ...
}
```
