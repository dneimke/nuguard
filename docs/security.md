### 1. Least Privilege

- Execute scans with minimal required permissions
- Avoid running with elevated/root privileges unless absolutely necessary
- Use dedicated service accounts with restricted access

### 2. Input Validation

- Validate all input parameters before processing
- Sanitize file paths and system commands
- Implement strong type checking for PowerShell functions

### 3. Secure Output Handling

- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Sanitize scan results before display
- Use secure channels for vulnerability reporting
